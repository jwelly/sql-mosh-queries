-- VIEWS

-- CREATE VIEWS creates a view object. It doesn't execute a query.
-- Views are reusable saved queries. We might have future queries that will be based on this query
-- For instance, we might what our top clients, or clients with least sales
-- You can select data from a view. Views can be used like a table!
USE sql_invoicing;
CREATE VIEW clients_balance AS
	SELECT
		c.client_id,
		c.name,
		SUM(invoice_total - payment_total) AS balance
	FROM clients c
	JOIN invoices i USING (client_id)
	GROUP BY 1, 2;

-- Altering or dropping views
-- Perhaps we encounter a problem. You can drop a view and recreate it.
-- Or you can use the REPLACE keyword: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name
-- BUT what if you don't have access to the query behind the view?
	-- You can save your views under SQL files and put them under source control and then in a Git repos.


-- If you don't have in our view, then it is an UPDATABLE VIEW, meaning, we can update data through it:
	-- DISTINCT, Agg functions (MIN, MAX, SUM..), GROUP BY / HAVING, UNION
-- As a result, we can use this view in INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements
-- NOTE: Updating a view will ALSO UPDATE THE ORIGINAL TABLE!!!


-- When you update or delete data through a VIEW, some of the rows may disappear
-- But you won't always want this.
-- WITH CHECK OPTION prevents exclusion of rows from an updated view.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW invoices_with_balance AS
SELECT
	invoice_id,
    number,
    client_id,

    invoice_date,
    due_date,
    payment_date
